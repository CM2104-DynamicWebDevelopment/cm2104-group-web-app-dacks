/*
    The following steps will walk you through setting up the server and relevant npm packages
    to the project.
    
    Within the project structure there should be a file called 'package.json' in the root. If
    that file isn't there follow these steps to install everything otherwise skip to the next 
    set of steps.
    
    -- STEPS TO INSTALL IF THERE'S NO PACKAGE.JSON FILE --
    1. Open the folder location of 'cm2104-group-web-app-dacks' on your codio terminal.
    2. Enter 'npm init' into the terminal.
       Set the description to 'COVID-19 Tracker' and the author to 'DACKS'.
    3. Enter 'npm install mongodb@2.2.33' into the terminal.
    4. Enter 'npm install express' into the terminal. 
    5. Enter 'npm install ejs' into the terminal.
    6. Enter 'npm install twitter' into the terminal.
    7. Enter 'npm start' into the terminal to start the server.
    
    -- STEPS TO INSTALL IF THERE IS PACKAGE.JSON FILE --
    1. Open the folder location of 'cm2104-group-web-app-dacks' on your codio terminal.
    2. Enter 'npm init' into the terminal.
       Keep pressing enter and the packages.json info will be inserted.
    3. Enter 'npm install' into the terminal.
       This will install all the packages listed in the 'packages.json' file.
    4. Enter 'npm start' into the terminal to start the server.
    
    If any errors occur, try installing the packages through the Install Software section in 'Tools'.
